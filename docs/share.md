# Sharing a result

`@/components/share-button` is the one share control, and `@/lib/share` draws a share card and
hands it (or a link) to the device's share sheet. Both use browser APIs only, so there is nothing to
install. Do not call `navigator.share` or draw text on a canvas yourself: the ways those go wrong
(text running off the card, no share sheet on a desktop, a closed sheet treated as an error) are
handled here.

## When to offer it

Offer sharing where someone has something worth showing: a result screen, a score, a finished
drawing, a summary, a streak, a plan they made. One `ShareButton` beside the result, labelled for
what it shares — "Share result", "Share score", "Share my plan". Not in the header, not on every
screen, and not before there is anything to share.

**Never share automatically.** Nothing opens a share sheet, saves an image or copies a link until
the visitor presses the button: not on load, not when a game ends, not on a timer. Browsers refuse a
share sheet without a click anyway, and an unasked one is the fastest way to lose someone's trust.

## A share card

```tsx
"use client";
import { ShareButton } from "@/components/share-button";
import { renderShareCard } from "@/lib/share";
import { identity } from "@/app/identity";

export function ResultShare({ score, best }: { score: number; best: number }) {
  return (
    <ShareButton
      label="Share score"
      title={`${score} points`}
      text={`I scored ${score} on ${identity.name}`}
      filename="my-score.png"
      makeImage={() =>
        renderShareCard({
          title: `${score} points`,
          subtitle: "Can you beat it?",
          lines: [`Personal best: ${best}`, "3 levels cleared"],
          format: "story",
        })
      }
    />
  );
}
```

`renderShareCard({ title, subtitle?, lines?, footer?, accent?, format? })` returns a PNG Blob: the
title large and bold, the subtitle under it, then each of `lines`, on a dark card with an accent
band across the top and the app's name at the bottom. Every part wraps to the card's width; what
still does not fit is left off from the end of `lines`, then the title is cut with "…". Keep the
title to a few words and each line to one short fact.

- `footer` defaults to the app's name and `accent` to the page's theme colour, both of which come
  from `app/identity.ts` (if this app has no such file, pass them).
- Use the visitor's own result, not their personal details: no email address, full name or
  location on a card unless they typed it in to put it there.

## Formats

| `format` | Size | For |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `story` | 1080×1920 | Instagram and Facebook Stories, Reels covers, TikTok, WhatsApp status. Content is kept clear of the top and bottom, where those apps put their own buttons. |
| `square` (default) | 1080×1080 | Feed posts, X, chats and messages. The safe choice when you do not know where it is going. |
| `wide` | 1200×630 | The shape of a link preview. Rarely needed as a file: see below. |

Pick the format for where people will post it. A phone-first app whose results go to Stories wants
`story`; otherwise `square`.

## Sharing the link instead

Without `makeImage`, `ShareButton` shares a link — `url`, or this page's address — and copies it
where there is no share sheet. The preview people see when the link is posted (title, description
and a 1200×630 image) comes free: it is generated from `app/identity.ts`, so there is nothing to
draw. Make sure the name and description there say what the app is.

## What each press can end in

Every state is text under the button, kept until the next press:

- "Preparing image…" while the card is drawn.
- "Shared" — the share sheet took it.
- "Image saved" — no share sheet that takes files here (most desktops), so it was downloaded.
- "Link copied" — no share sheet, so the link is on the clipboard.
- "Not shared" — the visitor closed the sheet. Not an error: nothing else happens.
- "Sharing isn't available here" — no share sheet and no clipboard; the link is written out to copy by hand.

## Your own controls

`shareImage(blob, { title, text?, filename })` resolves `"shared"`, `"saved"` or `"cancelled"`, and
`shareLink(url, { title, text? })` resolves `"shared"`, `"copied"`, `"cancelled"` or
`"unsupported"`; neither rejects. `shareStatusText(outcome)` gives the sentence for each. Call them
from a click handler, and show the result as text.

To show the card before sharing it, render it once when the result is ready, keep the Blob, show it
in an `<img>` (with `useObjectUrl` from `lib/files` if this app has it) and pass
`makeImage={async () => blob}`.

## Client only

All of this runs in the browser: import it from client components and call it from event
handlers, never during render.
